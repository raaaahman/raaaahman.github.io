F.A.I.R.I.E. is the interactive part of an **Alternate Reality Game** in this universe, spanning across multiple medias: a web series, a Discord server, a twitch channel...

The project implements the [Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev/) syntax by The Secret Lab, which is made to create interactive stories, and runs the stories inside a **Progressive Web Application**. It revolves around the concept of _social engineering_ and allows its users to communicate with the characters from the world of The Index through fake emails and phone calls. It also let the players search for clues through a _Command Line Interface_ and hacking inspired mini-games!

The project was made using _React_, _Styled Components_ and _Google Firebase_, under the vigilant overseeing of [Swordmonkey Studios](https://www.swordmonkey.com).
