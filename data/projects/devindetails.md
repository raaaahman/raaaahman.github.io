[Dev In Details](https://devindetails.com) is my personal blog where I share my thoughts and experiments about **front-end development**. Mostly through the making of _browser games_ using the Phaser framework.

You can find there my _game jam_ reports, some tutorials about front-end libraries and framework, and some explanations about various programming concepts like _paradigms_ and _design patterns_.

It is actually a _WordPress_ site, which should be migrated to a _Next.js_ application soon...
